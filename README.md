Rock-Paper-Scissors is an interactive online/webbrowser game based on the classic hand game that is usually played for making a decision by two persons. On this website, players can compete against the computer, that randomly chooses between rock, paper and scissors. There is no limit for playing rounds, and the score can be reset by any given time. Have fun playing!

# User Experience
## User Stories
* As a user who never played the game before, I want to learn the rules of the game by easily understandable instructions.
* As a user, I want to find interactive elements for playing the game, like buttons, in a short time.
* As a user, I want to find a clean layout, so I can find  my score and the score of the computer in a short time and view while playing the game.
* As a user, I want to be able to reset my and the computers' score and start a new game. 

# Design
## Colors
In terms of colors I chose a basic color scheme, as the focus of the website is the game itself. The primary colors are black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF). White is the background of the website and black is used for the texts, icons and borders of the respective areas like result area and score area. To highlight the scores and mark who is leading the game, the score of the leading player is highlighted in green (#008000), while the losing score is highlighted in red (#ff0000). When the players' score equals the computers' score, both scores are highlighted in yellow (#fcba03).
